# Setting up GitHub Repository for "No First Move" Fork

## Steps to Create the Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `No-first-move`
   - Description: `A fork of Whisk Tic Tac Toe with "No first move" concept to eliminate first-move advantage`
   - Make it Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **After creating the repository**, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/paulhorwitz/Desktop/No-first-move
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/No-first-move.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

4. **Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username in the command above.

## What This Fork Includes

- All original Whisk game files
- Updated README explaining the "No first move" concept
- Ready for implementing the no-first-move advantage rules
- Complete multiplayer functionality
- All deployment options remain the same

## Next Steps

After creating the repository, you can:
1. Implement the "no first move" rules in the game logic
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages for free hosting
3. Share the game with others

The repository is ready to be pushed to GitHub!
