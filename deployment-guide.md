## 🔧 Testing Your Deployment

### Local Testing
1. Open your game in two different browser windows

3. Join with the Game ID in the other window
4. Test the multiplayer functionality

### Cross-Device Testing
1. Deploy to one of the platforms above
2. Open the game on two different devices
3. Test the multiplayer connection

## 🌍 Network Considerations

### Firewall Issues
- Some corporate networks block WebRTC
- If connection fails, try from different networks
- Mobile data often works better than corporate WiFi

### NAT Traversal
- The game uses STUN servers to handle NAT traversal
- Most home networks work fine
- Some restrictive networks may have issues

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **Check Internet Connection**: Both players need stable internet
2. **Try Different Browsers**: Chrome/Edge work best
3. **Disable VPN**: VPNs can interfere with WebRTC
4. **Check Firewall**: Allow browser connections

### Game Not Loading
1. **Check File Paths**: Make sure all files are in the repository
2. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools for errors
3. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Multiplayer Not Working
1. **Check Game ID**: Make sure the ID is copied correctly
2. **Try Again**: Sometimes first connection attempt fails
3. **Refresh Page**: If stuck, refresh both players' pages

## 📊 Performance Tips

### For Better Performance
1. **Use Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Stable Connection**: Wired internet preferred over WiFi
3. **Close Other Tabs**: Free up browser resources
4. **Update Browser**: Use latest browser versions

### For Mobile Users
1. **Use Landscape Mode**: Better for game board visibility
2. **Zoom Out**: Make sure the full board is visible
3. **Stable WiFi**: Mobile data can be unstable
